# SQL-Injection-Guide
Some tips and documentation for SQL injection

This was heavily based off the Web Security Academy course from PortSwigger.  I highly encourage any reader to enroll and complete the SQL Injection course before reading this, as it has solutions to the lab. This repository is going to be used mostly for self-reference and was developed AFTER completed each PortSwigger lab. it should not be used to cheat the PortSwigger labs.

A SQL injection should not be performed on a system you do not have authorizaiton to perform it on.
